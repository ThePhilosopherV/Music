A theory about music
My intentions are to try to bring poetry to music without sacrificing the modern artistic touch, and in my opinion if we manage to save poetry we will safe philosophy as well and by no means I’m trying to give hints that philosophy might be on the ‘death bed’ but it’s living under a natural crisis.
 My suggestions:
*Words are important:
Every word is significant and this genre will have an emphasis on every word.
*Space between words
The ‘nothingness’/silence between every word is as important as the words themselves so they should be interesting and magical/meaningful as well.
*Every time it’s a new/different song
Have you ever felt in love in a song that you don’t want it to stop? I came up with a solution and it’s to make the background music different with every time the song is being run/(heard ?), this solution will need a programmatical  implementation.
* When words are being spoken silence should reign 
I think for reasons related to giving words more spotlight when words are being spoken the background music should be ‘non-existent’.
*Singing is now reading   
Singing now is reading and with this idea meaning is something crucial and inescapable. 
*Singing is now public 
With this theory singing will no longer be an elite practice but this doesn’t mean there is no room for uniqueness.
*Reviving intellectual music
Ideas being expressed artistically are more capable of reaching the heart.
*Inside every genius there is a musician
*The deeper you get in life you closest you get to the song of the universe.
*Nature expresses itself using sound.
*Chaos is not something we need to eliminate it’s something to be listen to.
*Music needs to create puzzles 
(Updates coming soon on the practical implementations of this theory.)
